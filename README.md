## Drawbot
 - Made for [Hack Club Highway](https://highway.hackclub.com/)
 - I never got a blot and I want a drawing machine
### Goals:
 - Print size letter paper or larger
 - Fast speed
     - CoreXY
         - Pros:
             - much faster
             - steppers are stationary
             - one belt
             - less weight on moving parts (stuff around pen)
             - therefore, more possible acceleration and speed
         - Cons:
             - much more complicated
                - harder to design
                - harder to manufacture
             - more parts
             - more expensive
     - High speed stepper motors
     - High speed servo for pen up and down
     - Good firmware to get the most speed out of the steppers
 - Cheap
 - Open source (obv)
